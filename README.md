## Introduction
The increasing prevalence of online transactions and electronic payments has led to a surge in credit card fraud. As a response to this challenge, the field of computer networks has played a pivotal role in the development of sophisticated fraud detection systems. This project aims to explore the techniques and methodologies used in designing and implementing a Credit Card Fraud Detection System, leveraging the principles of computer networks and data analysis.

## Project Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are as follows:
1. **Understanding Credit Card Fraud:** Gain insight into various types of credit card fraud, their common characteristics, and the importance of detecting fraudulent activities.
2. **Exploring Data Sources:** Identify and acquire relevant datasets containing credit card transaction information for both legitimate and fraudulent transactions. Dataset: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection">Kaggle</a>
3. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean, preprocess, and transform the acquired data into a suitable format for analysis and modeling.
4. **Feature Extraction:** Investigate relevant features from the transaction data that can serve as inputs to the fraud detection model.
5. **ML Algorithm Selection:** Study different machine learning and data mining algorithms suitable for fraud detection, including anomaly detection, clustering, and classification methods.
6. **Model Design:** Design a credit card fraud detection system that integrates the selected algorithms. Consider aspects such as model architecture, feature selection, and ensemble methods.
7. **Evaluation Metrics:** Define appropriate metrics for evaluating the performance of the detection system, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
8. **Implementation:** Implement the designed system using a programming language such as Python, and utilize relevant libraries and frameworks for machine learning and data analysis.
9. **Validation and Testing:** Validate the system using cross-validation techniques and fine-tune parameters to achieve optimal performance.

## Usage
1. **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset is loaded from a CSV file and preprocessed to transform the data into a suitable format for analysis and modeling.
2. **Model Training:** A logistic regression model is trained using the preprocessed data and saved to a file for future use.
3. **Model Evaluation:** The trained model is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.
4. **Prediction Function:** A function is provided to make predictions for user input based on the trained model.

## Conclusion
This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of credit card fraud detection systems and their implementation using machine learning techniques. By following the outlined objectives and code examples, users can gain insights into the process of designing and implementing a fraud detection system.
